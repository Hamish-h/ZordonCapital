## Shares App

A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a minimal viable product (MVP) that uses the data to display her portfolio in useful ways so that she can make better decisions.

## MVP

- View total current value
- View individual and total performance trends
- Retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and allow the user to add shares to her portfolio
- Provide a chart of the current values in her portfolio

## Examples of Further Features

- Speculation based on trends and further financial modelling using projections.
